# Tableau
Created Tableau dashboard using FABVIZ framework.
I utilized the FABVIZ framework to develop a Tableau dashboard, employing data from Superstore, a prominent US-based retailer offering a vast range of furniture, office supplies, and technology products. Within the dashboard, I designed both a sales report and a data exploration dashboard, facilitating an in-depth analysis of the provided dataset.

**Data Exploration dashboard** : The FABVIS data exploration dashboard adopts a four-pane window format, with the initial pane presenting a broad overview and the last pane offering a comprehensive level of detail. To enhance interactivity, the dashboard incorporates actions that enable users to interact effectively with the data.

**Sales Report**: The report dashboard follows the Big Numbers format, featuring one or two straightforward charts and up to five prominent numerical values displayed across the top. This format effectively presents total sales, profit, and quantity trends over the years, utilizing a line chart to visualize the data.
